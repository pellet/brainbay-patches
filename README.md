# BrainBay neurofeedback patches

This repository is my attempt at creating neurofeedback protocols in BrainBay for Infra-Low Frequency, Sensorimotor Rhythmn and Alpha/Theta patches.

I've also modified a couple of open source apps to control display brightness and audio volume via OSC(Open Sound Control) for feedback on Windows and MacOS.

### [Monitorian fork for Windows](https://github.com/pellet/Monitorian/tree/feature/osc_receiver)

### [MonitorControl fork for MacOS](https://github.com/pellet/MonitorControl/tree/control_with_osc)

BrainBay configurations can be found under each respective sub-directory.


Configurations are named like so:

(NEUROFEEDBACK STYLE)_(REFERENCE POSITION)-(ACTUAL POSITIONS).conf
